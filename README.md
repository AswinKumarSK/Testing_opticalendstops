# Testing_opticalendstops
This repository contains code for testing optical endstops using C++ and Python. The C++ file demonstrates how to read signals from endstops using an Arduino, while the Python file uses Pyfirmata. This code can serve as a reference for anyone working with optical endstops and is open for contributions.
