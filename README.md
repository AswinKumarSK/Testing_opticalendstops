# Testing_opticalendstops
This repository contains code for testing optical endstops using C++ and Python. The C++ file demonstrates how to read signals from endstops using an Arduino, while the Python file uses Pyfirmata. This code can serve as a reference for anyone working with optical endstops and is open for contributions.
This repository contains code for testing optical endstops using both C++ and Python.

# Optical Endstops

This repository contains code for testing optical endstops using both C++ and Python.

## Files

- `optical_endstops.ino`: C++ file that demonstrates how to read signals from optical endstops
- `test_optical_endstops.py`: Python file that uses Pyfirmata to test optical endstops

## Getting Started

To run the C++ code, you will need a C++ compiler installed on your machine or Use an Arduino Ide


To run the Python code, you will need to install Pyfirmata. You can install it using pip:
```pip install pyfirmata```

Once you have Pyfirmata installed, you can run the Python script using the following command:
```python test_optical_endstops.py```

## Contributing

If you find any issues with the code or would like to contribute to the repository, please feel free to create a pull request or submit an issue.
